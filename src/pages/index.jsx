        Heyy There <b>ðŸ‘‹</b>! I am Whirl a self taught full stack developer. I
        am currently learning new javascript <i>frameworks</i> and db's. I love
        playing online games and programming, Though rather unlike some of my
        friends i do not aspire to be a programmer. I'm <i>as of now</i> a 99
        year old <b>student</b> which effectively means i run short on time due
        to studies and other stuff.
